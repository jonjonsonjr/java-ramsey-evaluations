java ramsey evaluations
======================

Initial java implementations to evaluate the number of monochromatic cliques in a complete graph. This was just a proof of concept, but I felt it might be worth sharing with the world.

See [our CUDA implementation](https://github.com/jonjonsonjr/ramsey) for this project's evolution.
